## Part 1 - TCP/IP the foundation
We need to have a basic understanding of the layer underneath us - TCP/IP. TCP/IP is hard to build, but can be simple to use, so it is a great foundation to stand on.
It also provides some motivation for a protocol and understanding of the basic tools.

### 1.1 ðŸ§± - Basic chatting with netcat over TCP/IP
This is a must-do. Let's just talk locally over TCP/IP using netcat.
To listen on a port
```
nc -l localhost 8080
```

To connect to that port
```
nc localhost 8080 
```

### 1.2 ðŸ’¡Hanging up properly, closing sockets
This is nice, useful to understand how HTTP sockets work and scale and get re-used etc, but not required for the workshop.

### 1.3 ðŸ’¡Finding the IP adress of domains using nslookup

### 1.4 ðŸŽ“ Inspecting traffic with tcpdump and/or wireshark.

### 1.5 ðŸŽ“ Chatting to a machine in the cloud
Setting up netcat on a publicly accessible virtual machine. Allow you to talk to multiple users.
